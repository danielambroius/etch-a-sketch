==============================

### ColorPicker
simply doubleclick on any cell, the pencil will then assume the color of the cell. (Maybe colorpicker could show upp at some keypress)

### PenOnOff
Pen activation/deactivation should map to holding down some button.

### ResetGrid
buttom somewhere or a key that resets the grid with variable cellsize

### transparency
On each mouseover it should get darker (erhaps through some nice sorted pallete based on selected color)
